# CCL_Clay3DP — Rhino 8 Plugin for Clay 3D Printing

**Version: Alpha 1.1.0 — NOT a release candidate. Use at your own risk.**

> 🚧 This plugin is in **alpha**. It is actively used in the CCL lab but is
> not feature-frozen, has not been independently audited, and is known to
> have rough edges. Generated robot programs MUST be reviewed in RoboDK
> simulation before running on real hardware. The authors assume no

> in [LICENSE](LICENSE) §7 and limitation of liability in §8).

A Rhino 8 plugin that takes a 3D part in Rhino, slices it into a spiral
toolpath, checks its printability for clay, and sends it straight to RoboDK
as a robot machining project — ready to run on a Kuka KR 10 R1100-2 with a
Stoneflower clay extruder.

**One input, one output.** Pick a Rhino geometry, press a button, get a
robot program. No intermediate STL / G-code files, no Cura, no manual
configuration in RoboDK.

> ## ⚠ About this project

> **CCL_Clay3DP was developed at the CyberCraft Lab (CCL),
> Ostbayerische Technische Hochschule (OTH) Regensburg, by
> Prof. Christophe Barlieb, for use with the lab's specific hardware

>
> It is therefore tightly coupled to that setup — named RoboDK frames
> (`T10`, `T11`, `T12`, `BasePlate02`), a specific Kuka robot model,
> a custom KUKA CNC ISG post processor, and the Stoneflower paste
> extruder workflow. **It is not a general-purpose clay slicer.**

## What it does

1. **Toolpath generator** — two modes, chosen in Settings:
   - **Spiral Slice** — continuous spiral between horizontal contours
     (vase mode, no Z-seam).
   - **Layer Slice** — discrete planar layer contours. With the optional
     **Inner Wall Bracing** flag, each layer also gets an inward-offset
     inner wall plus a triangle-wave "bracing" rib between the two walls
     for structural stiffening. Robot print order per layer is
     **Inner Toolpath → Outer Toolpath → Bracing Toolpath**, then up to
     the next layer.
2. **Printability analysis** — colors the geometry mesh in the viewport
   with a red-yellow-green heatmap showing where clay printing is at risk
   (overhang angles, layer bond, robot wrist velocity). Works in every
   mode; three channels (Clay, Robot, Both) all render to the mesh.
3. **Preview Clay Model** — renders whichever toolpath curves exist
   (`Spiral Toolpath` / `Outer Toolpath` / `Inner Toolpath` /
   `Bracing Toolpath`) as mesh bead tubes at the configured Clay bead
   diameter, with mesh-sphere joints at every vertex for continuity.
4. **RoboDK integration** — opens the pre-configured `3DP_v0.4.rdk`
   station, adds the toolpath as a Curve Follow object under the build
   plate, links it to the `3DP_Template` machining project, and
   regenerates the robot program using the CYARC KUKA post processor.

**Workflow gating.** The Settings form is the first thing the user must
interact with; all other workflow buttons (Slice, Analyze, Send, Preview Clay Model)
stay disabled until Settings has been reviewed once in the session.
Switching between Spiral and Layer modes automatically clears the other
mode's generated layers on the next Slice, so the Rhino Layers panel
always reflects only the current mode.

### Rhino layers produced

All output lives under a shared `3DP` parent layer. Only the layers that
the current slice mode needs are created; switching modes removes the
others on the next Slice.

| Layer | Content | Visible by default |
|---|---|---|
| `3DP::Spiral Toolpath` | The spiral curve (Spiral mode) | yes |
| `3DP::Ribbon` | Tool-orientation ribbon mesh (Spiral mode) | no (debug aid) |
| `3DP::Outer Toolpath` | Outer wall curve per layer (Layer mode) | yes |
| `3DP::Inner Toolpath` | Inner wall curve per layer (Layer + Bracing) | yes |
| `3DP::Bracing Toolpath` | Triangle-wave rib per layer (Layer + Bracing) | yes |
| `3DP::Bracing Vectors` | Inward-direction arrows (Layer + Bracing) | no (flip preview) |
| `3DP::Bracing Outer Points` | Sample points on outer wall (Layer + Bracing) | no |
| `3DP::Bracing Inner Points` | Sample points on inner wall (Layer + Bracing) | no |
| `3DP::Clay Model` | Mesh-bead visualization (any mode, Preview Clay Model button) | yes |
| `3DP::Heatmap` | Vertex-colored input mesh (Analyze) | yes |

In Layer + Bracing mode, picking **Yes** for the "flip inward direction"
prompt swaps which underlying curve lands on the `Outer Toolpath` vs.
`Inner Toolpath` layer so the names always match what's geometrically
outer vs. inner.

## Prerequisites

- **Rhino 8** (uses Eto.Forms + RhinoCommon 8.x)
- **.NET Framework 4.8** for building the plugin
- **RoboDK** with the Python API (`C:\RoboDK\Python`) installed
- **Kuka KR 10 R1100-2 station** with the following items:
  - Robot named `KUKA KR 10 R1100-2`
  - Tool named `BasePlate02` (the build plate on the robot)
  - Reference frames named `T10`, `T11`, `T12` (nozzle TCPs)
  - A pre-configured `3DP_Template` machining project
- The bundled **KUKA CNC ISG post processor** installed into RoboDK
  (see below)

## Post processor installation

The plugin drives a custom KUKA CNC 2.1 ISG post processor that
handles `#HSC` BSPLINE smoothing, the `T<N> M6` tool change derived
from the reference frame, and extruder lead compensation.

The post processor lives in this repository at:

```
PostProcessor/KUKA_CNC_2_1_ISG_CCL_3DP_WIP_MS_S_INT_HSC_WAIT_S_DELAY.py
```

**You must copy it into RoboDK's `Posts` folder** for RoboDK to find
it. On a standard Windows install that is:

```
C:\RoboDK\Posts\KUKA_CNC_2_1_ISG_CCL_3DP_WIP_MS_S_INT_HSC_WAIT_S_DELAY.py
```

If RoboDK is installed somewhere else, drop the file into the
equivalent `Posts\` folder inside your RoboDK installation
directory. The filename must match exactly — the plugin references
it by name at runtime.

After copying, in RoboDK you can verify the post is recognised via:
**Program → Add/Edit Post Processor → Select Post → pick
`KUKA_CNC_2_1_ISG_CCL_3DP_WIP_MS_S_INT_HSC_WAIT_S_DELAY`**. The
plugin's `RoboDKSubprocess.cs` assigns it automatically on the robot
each time *Send to RoboDK* runs, so no manual selection is needed
during normal operation.

The bundled post is a modification of RoboDK Inc.'s original KUKA
CNC 2.1 ISG Kernel post (Apache-2.0). CCL modifications are listed
in the file header and in [NOTICE](NOTICE).

## Building

```bash
cd CCL_Clay3DP
dotnet build
```

The output DLL lands in `bin\Debug\CCL_Clay3DP.dll`. Load it in
Rhino via `_PlugInManager → Install…`.

## Using the plugin

1. Open Rhino, type `CCL_Clay3DP` to show the dockable panel.
2. Click **Settings** to configure:
   - **Clay material**: preset (Porcelain / Stoneware / Earthenware) or
     custom bead diameter, max overhang, bond ratio, density.
   - **Spiral toolpath**: layer height, frames per layer, direction, etc.
   - **Robot / printer**: feed rate (mm/s), travel speed, spindle S value,
     nozzle tool (T10/T11/T12), RoboDK paths.
3. Click **1. Spiral Slice** — pick a Brep/Mesh in Rhino. The plugin
   generates the spiral toolpath on `3DP::Contours`, `3DP::Spiral Toolpath`
   and `3DP::Ribbon` layers.
4. Click **2. Analyze** — choose the heatmap channel (Clay, Robot, Both).
   The geometry mesh is recolored on `3DP::Heatmap`.
5. Click **3. Send to RoboDK** — opens RoboDK, loads the station template,
   adds the curve under `BasePlate02`, links it to `3DP_Template`,
   regenerates the program. All speeds, spindle, and reference frame come
   from the plugin settings.

## RoboDK station expectations

The `3DP_v0.4.rdk` station must contain a machining project named
`3DP_Template` that the plugin will populate. On first use, configure it
once:

- Robot = `KUKA KR 10 R1100-2`
- Tool = `BasePlate02`
- Reference = one of `T10` / `T11` / `T12` (the plugin overrides this per run)
- Algorithm = `Robot holds object`
- `Aproach/Retract each curve` unchecked (the plugin enforces this anyway)
- Post processor set to the custom CYARC KUKA CNC post

Save the station. From then on, the plugin manages everything
programmatically via the `Machining` and `ProgEvents` param dicts.

## Settings propagated from plugin to RoboDK

| Plugin setting | RoboDK parameter | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `FeedRate` | `SpeedOperation` | Operation speed along the curve |
| `TravelSpeed` | `SpeedRapid` | Approach / retract speed |
| `SpindleSpeed` | `CallPathStart` event | `S<value>` inserted before first curve point |
| `NozzleTool` | `PoseFrame` on template | T10 / T11 / T12 frame becomes the reference |
| (always 0) | `ApproachRetractAll` | Disables per-curve approach/retract |
| (always `S1`) | `CallPathFinish` event | Extruder off after last curve point |
| (always 0) | `Rounding` / `RoundingOn` | No blending (KUKA CNC handles via `#HSC`) |

## Troubleshooting

- **Rhino crashes when opening Settings** → make sure the `FileFilter`
  API call uses separate `name` and `ext` arguments (not the WinForms
  pipe-delimited string).
- **Plugin won't load after rebuild** → Rhino locks the DLL; close Rhino
  before `dotnet build`.
- **`3DP_Template` machining project not found** → create it once in the
  station as described above and save the `.rdk` file.
- **T10/T11/T12 not applied** → the template's pose frame is set via
  `setPoseFrame` at run time; ensure the frame names in the station match
  exactly.

## Credits

Developed by the **CyberCraft Lab (CCL)**, Ostbayerische Technische
Hochschule (OTH) Regensburg, under **Prof. Christophe Barlieb**,
founder of the CyberCraft Lab and co-founder of the CyberCraft
Kolleg — who led the design of the print workflow, the spiral-slice
strategy, and the integration with the CCL-ALTAR-01 cell.

The plugin is tuned for the **CCL-ALTAR-01** setup:

- KUKA KR 10 R1100-2 robot arm
- Fixed Stoneflower paste/clay extruder (nozzle TCPs `T10` / `T11` / `T12`)
- Robot-held build plate (`BasePlate02`)
- KUKA CNC ISG 2.1 controller
- Custom post processor with HSC BSPLINE smoothing and extruder
  lead compensation

### Adapting to your own lab

If you want to use this plugin with different hardware, the pieces
most likely to need rewiring are:

| File | What's lab-specific |
|---|---|
| `RoboDK/RoboDKSubprocess.cs` | Robot / tool / frame names, post processor path, the `3DP_Template` machining project assumption |
| `Models/RobotSettings.cs` | Default paths to RoboDK, default station template, nozzle tool list |
| `Settings/SettingsDialog.cs` | Nozzle dropdown options (`T10`/`T11`/`T12`) |
| Your copy of the KUKA post processor | G-code style, tool-change command syntax, spindle command mapping |

The **slicer** (`Core/`), the **printability analyzer**
(`Analysis/`), and the plugin scaffolding (`UI/`, `Settings/`,
`Commands/`) are generic and should run on any Rhino 8 install
without changes.

Feedback, bug reports, and pull requests are welcome via the public
repository. Please keep the Apache 2.0 license, the LICENSE/NOTICE
files, and the attribution headers intact in any derivative work.

## Development note

This plugin was developed iteratively with the help of Anthropic's
**Claude** (Opus 4.7) acting as a pair-programming assistant, under
the direction of Prof. Christophe Barlieb at the CyberCraft Lab. The
domain expertise (hardware setup, KUKA CNC post processor tuning,
Stoneflower extruder calibration, and the overall print workflow) is
the lab's; the AI assisted with C# scaffolding, refactoring, Eto.Forms
panel plumbing, and boilerplate generation. Commits where Claude
contributed significantly are tagged with `Co-Authored-By:
Claude Opus 4.7` trailers in the git log.

As with any AI-assisted code, we recommend reviewing critical paths
(especially the RoboDK and post-processor interaction in
`RoboDK/RoboDKSubprocess.cs`) before using the plugin on production
hardware.
